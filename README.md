# static-site-boilerplate
Boilerplate repo for simple static websites.

Literally just HTML, CSS, and JS linked together properly. I probably set this up 1-2 times per week, and it was time to abstract it out.

Things it includes:
- Linked CSS file
- Linked JS file
- Meta viewport tag
- Box sizing and font on all elements
- Body margin reset

Also includes SCSS and the proper `.gitignore`, just run `sass --watch style.scss:style.css`. Or don't, and write directly to `style.css`.
